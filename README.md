# A-Deep-Learning-Journey
This repository will have many interesting and inspiring projects to help me get the hang of deep learning stuffs :)

## Currently working on ...
 Neural Networks: Zero to Hero by **Andrej Karpathy**\
 I implemented the Micrograd according to Andrej's YouTube video.\
 Micrograd is really a great toy project for me to understand what is happening in the forward and backward propagation.\
 And also understand the concept of computation graph as well as how to maintain it.
